<img src="assets/images/EyeOfMadnessSmol.png" alt="Symbol of Madness" width="95%">
i am an aspiring software developer with a heart of dreams, mind overflowing with ideas, and a gut full of Dr. Pepper. Most of my ideas include the creation of various types of video games that i would like to have existing, but don't as of the moment due to me not having the skills needed to make it happen.

i may be addicted to Dr. Pepper, and the image of the eye is my symbol of madness

###favorite
my favorite story story to have ever witnessed is Homestuck, which is a very complicated and ridiculous webcomic about a group of kids that play a game and bring the apocalypse to the earth. Also my favorite kind of music is Heavy Metal.
